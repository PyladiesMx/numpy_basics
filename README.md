# Numpy and Python Basics

Hello Everyone! This is a little notebook that I made with the requirements for numpy in the second lesson of the Facebook Pytorch Challege. Feel free to ad and contribute.

### Requirements

1. python >= 3.6
2. jupyter notebook
3. numpy 

You can also Run this notebook in colab. [Here](https://medium.com/@margaretmz/running-jupyter-notebook-with-colab-f4a29a9c7156) is a super quick guide on how to do it.
